Learning to search (L2S) is a form of guided reinforcement learning used for solving complex joint prediction problems based on learning to search through a problem-defined search space. Vowpal Wabbit features a predefined structured prediction model for the L2S method. For more on how to use Vowpal Wabbit in an L2S setting, <a href="http://hunch.net/~l2s" target="_blank">see the learning to search tutorial</a>.
