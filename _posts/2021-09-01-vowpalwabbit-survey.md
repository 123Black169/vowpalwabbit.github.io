As is the case with most open source projects, we have very little insight into how the project is used. VW does not collect any telemetry, so we rely on inferring usage patterns based on questions asked on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/VowpalWabbit/community), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vowpalwabbit) and issues raised on the [Github repository](https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/). In order to better prioritize issues, new features and the direction of the project we decided to create a survey to give us some insight into how VW is used.

- This survey is completely opt-in
- Responses are anonymous
- If you provide any personally identifiable information in any of the responses you give then we will delete the entire response

If you use VW and would like to help out the project then offering us some insight into how you use it is a fantastic way to help.

Thank you in advance!
